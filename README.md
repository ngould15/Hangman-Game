# Hangman-Game
<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>This is a simple hangman game with an old-school Nickelodeon theme. To begin playing the game, just guess a letter by typing it on your keyboard. If you guess incorrectly 9 times, you lose. If you guess the word before that happens, you win! If you win, your win count will increase by "1" and then you will move on to the next word. If you lose, your lose count will increase by "1" and then you will move on to the next word. </p>
